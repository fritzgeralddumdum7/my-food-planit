    "Hey, we don't automatically import the recipe instructions when you import a recipe. Why? Well, bloggers and recipe creators often rely on traffic to their sites for their livelihood and we want to respect that. We don't need the instructions to make shopping lists and get nutrition facts and you can visit the site when you are ready to cook. If you still want to import the instructions, you can do so by clicking here, otherwise, just visit the link when you need the instructions to make the recipe.",
